“Office” Hours: [M/W 10:00-11:30 ](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUl1Q3FiaDNnQWZxfGRlZmF1bHR8YmY4YWJhNjM5ZTBjMmYwZmM5ZDcyMTQ5NTNmYmE2ZGM) on ZOOM or in ST 310P

## Objectives
On completion, students should be able to:
* Create intentionally designed maps and other data visualizations using web-based platforms
* Combine data, design and code from across platforms to create a single interactive map-based narrative
* Articulate cartographic and design choices in planning and critiquing map-based work

## Catalog Description
This course introduces the fundamental theories, art and science of map making using web-based platforms. It provides an interdisciplinary approach for students to learn both practical and conceptual skills to collect, interpret and present data in the form of online, interactive maps and data visualizations.

## Course Description
The ability to create cartographic representations on computers, and then share them as interactive documents via digital communications systems (i.e. the Internet) has been the greatest transformation in cartography in centuries. Anyone with a web browser can throw a map up online in a matter of minutes now, but creating well-designed, clear, and responsible maps that convey the exact information, or message, or feeling of the map-maker: that takes training and careful planning. This course is designed to give you a solid foundation in cartographic principles, working with spatial data, and the ethics of visualizing information. From that foundation you will be able to build any number of web-mapping experiences.
No experience with GIS, coding or design is expected for the course, though you will be able to draw on those skills if you have them.

## Course Structure
This is primarily a project based course, where you will learn-by-doing. As with many design+software courses, I cannot possibly teach you everything you need to know -- the platforms themselves change every few months it seems--so the goal of this course is very much to teach you what is possible and to learn how to learn to do the things you want. In short, I want you to come out of the class being able to ask “I want a map that does _______, how do I make that happen?” and be able to answer that question. To that end:  

**Mondays:** We will have synchronous lectures, discussion and tutorials in class. I expect you to be present the whole time, having done any readings, and be prepared to ask questions and discuss ideas. Any content I share during class will be shared after class in our slack channel.

**Wednesdays:** We will have asynchronous project development time via SLACK. In short: by the end of the class period, you will need to show progress on your project via updates on our slack channel, but you are welcome to do that anytime before Wednesday morning. There will not be synchronous class at this time, but I will be available to help troubleshoot problems and discuss ideas.

## Software:
The main software you need for this class is a modern web browser. I will use Chrome for teaching, but Safari or Firefox should work just as well. We will, however, be using many different platforms throughout the semester, so you’ll need to be organized about usernames & passwords. I recommend setting up a password manager sooner rather than later, or at least maring a place in a notebook to keep track.


We will be using a variety of software packages for this course. The majority are free, opensource and platform independent. Students are expected to install and/or have access to the following on their personal computers or machines provided in ST 323.
- ATOM [download](https://atom.io/)  
ATOM is an industry standard "text editor," but it does a whole lot more. We will use it to do some basic coding and editing of files throughout the semester. You can use any text editor, if you have something you are already familiar and comfortable with, but getting used to ATOM is a good idea if you're starting from scratch.

- Zoom [sign up / download](https://zoom.us/)  
If you have not yet setup a zoom account via WSU yet, please do so now.

- Slack [sign up / download](https://slack.com/)  
Slack is increasingly the standard for communication in digital-work, so we will be using it for this class for most of our communication and assignments (see below). Even if you only learn how to navigate slack this semester, this class will be worth it for professional development -- though I would prefer you also learn how to make engaging maps.  
I encourage you to install the desktop client on your own computer / mobile device if you wish. The web interface works fine, but is a slight hassle.

- Storymaps / ArcGIS online (account created via WSU)
ArcGIS online and Storymaps will be the one non-free software we use all semester -- though it is free to you now as a WSU student. There is nothing to install.

- Mapbox: (we will create accounts in class)  
Mapbox is the dominant web platform, as of right now, for a lot of web mapping. Their _free_ tier is great for learning on, but professional use requires paying for licenses.

- GitHub [sign up / download](https://github.com/)  
Github has become the global repository for almost all open source (and some private) software development -- including this website, look at the URL! -- and it has a steep learning curve, but we will use some of its basic, but powerful, functions to build maps. As with Slack, its uses extend far beyond maps, so its a great software to get familiar with.

# Coursework
Again, this is a studio style class where most of what we will do is develop, design, produce, critique, and revise projects.
## Reading
Most weeks there will be a short reading from one of several online sources (i.e. you don’t need to buy any books unless you want to). You will be expected to have done the reading by the class for which it is assigned and be prepared to discuss it in class on Monday. We will read a mixture of technical, instructional and conceptual pieces for the class. As you will see below, I will also encourage you to bring the reading discussions onto our slack channel.

## Community Contributions [25 pts]
Because this class is a ‘studio,’ it will be very community focused, and I expect students to contribute by sharing ideas, information and helping each other solve problems -- I will of course do the same. We will primarily use slack to keep our community connected, asynchronous, and searchable.
By the end of the class period on Wednesday, I expect you to have posted a minimum of two of the following:
- A reflection on reading or lecture (at least 100 words, complete sentences)
- A description of a problem or issue you are having with your project development
- A response to a classmate’s question with a solution or suggestion
- A tip/trick/discovery you’ve made that you think will be useful to your classmates

## Projects [75 pts]
There will be four projects across the semester:

### Project 1: A Migration Story (10 pts)  
**Due 9/20**  
We will use StoryMaps to explore how interactive maps, combined with text, can create a compelling narrative about people and places (otherwise known as geography). This project will help you get your feet wet with working with online spatial data as well as thinking about multiple scales, layers and interactivity.

### Project 2: A Greener Worcester (20 pts)  
**Due 10/04**  
We will use [MapBox](mapbox.com) to create our own base-maps. The focus of the project will be creating a design that evokes a “greener worcester,” by bringing forth elements that will highlight potential sustainability efforts in the city. It will give you a grounding in basic cartographic principles as well as planning design choices in advance of completing a project.

### Project 3: Money, Power and Politics in Voting (20 pts)
**Due 11/1**  (though you may want to finish and share early!)  
We will use [Leafleft.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and GitHub to create custom visualizations of donor data and voter turnout in Massachusetts. This will give you an opportunity to “get under the hood” of web-mapping and see/think about how code both limits and enables different types of cartographic expression. It will also be an opportunity to think carefully about what kind of data is available, how it gets represented and ethical choices when mapping.

### Project 4: Final Project TBA (25 pts) Due 12/13
Students will develop their own mapping projects using a combination of the above softwares and concepts. You will be responsible for creating a design document and plan, as well as acquiring any data or materials necessary for your project, and executing the final map by the end of the semester.
_NOTE: if there is student consensus, I will design a final project around an already existing dataset._
